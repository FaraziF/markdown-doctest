Time for es6 support

so examples like this

```es6
const a = 5;

const b = _ => 'foo';

class Foo {
  constructor (bar, baz) {
    this.bar = bar;
    this.baz = baz;
  }
}
```

But nobody writes examples using that syntax except for me


So we should always use es6?

```js
const maybe = _ => 'indeed';

const [a, b] = [1, 2];
```
